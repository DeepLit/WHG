		<definition>CH3C(=O)-CH2CH2 also known as methyl ethyl ketone, 2-butanone is a product of the manufacturing of paints, glues, and other finishes because of its dissolving ability. A byproduct in the exhaust of automobiles, 2-butanone can easily evaporate into the atmosphere. It has been detected in both indoor and outdoor air. While in outdoor air it is produced by the photoxidation of certain air pollutants, such as butane and other hydrocarbons. Is known to have negative health effects when breathed in at high concentrations.

	<entry term="1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene">
		<definition>A colorless, flammable liquid with the formula C9H12. It occurs naturally in coal tar and petroleum crude oil and therefore ends up in gasoline. It is a major component (typically 40%) of a petroleum refinery distillation fraction known as the C9 aromatic fraction. Oil refineries produce large amounts of this substance each year. Most of the C9 fraction is usually added directly to gasoline. Exposure to 1,2,4 trimethylbenzene can occur in the workplace or in the environment following releases to air, water, land, or groundwater. Vehicle emissions are a major anthropogenic source of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, due to its widespread occurrence in gasoline. Once in air, it breaks down and contributes to photochemical smog when it reacts with other volatile substance. This compound is also used by industries as chemical raw materials, paint thinners, and solvents. [Atmospheric environment; v37; P2485-2496; 2003; DOI:10.1016/S1352-2310(03)00177-8]</definition>

	<entry term="Adiabatic Lapse Rate">
		<definition>The rate of decrease of temperature with increasing altitude in the atmosphere. If heat is neither gained nor lost from the air parcel under consideration, then the lapse rate is said to be adiabatic and the energy to expand the volume of the parcel or rising air comes from the kinetic energy of the gas molecules in that parcel. The expansion of the parcel causes these molecules net kinetic velocity to decrease and this is equivalent to cooling the air. In dry air the dry adiabatic lapse rate is about 9.8 C/km (the sign is traditionally positive although the temperature is decreasing with altitude).See Foehn. In moist air the release of latent heat by condensation of the contained moisture makes the lapse rate lower, ~ 4 C/km. Surface temperature inversions are created when the lapse rate goes negative, that is, when the temperature profile of low lying tropospheric air increases with altitude. Air at the earth's surface is trapped there because the air above it is less warmer and less dense. This can be disastrous for the air quality in urban areas when anthropogenic pollutants are not mixed away from the surface and, instead, build up. [Graedel, T.D. and Paul Crutzen.

It reacts with strong acids and is one of the only known basic, gas phase atmospheric components. Atmospheric ammonia can also enhance the nucleation rate and the production of new particles in the atmosphere. These new particles can be activated to become condensation nuclei and then, through various processes, grow to a particle size of 0.05 micrometer or larger which can then be effective as cloud condensation nuclei. This process can, therefore, affect the global radiation budget. The major sources of ammonia are decaying natural organic matter, livestock wastes, fertilizers, and industrial activity.

	<entry term="Antarctic Ozone Hole">
		<definition>Recent data suggest that due to the release into the atmosphere of CFCs by human activities, the ozone hole can as large as North America during a given astral spring. The CFCs are broken apart by UV light--to form free radicals of chlorine--after they have diffused into the upper stratosphere from the troposphere. This long term movement from the troposphere to the stratosphere is possible for these chlorine containing chemicals because of there long atmospheric lifetimes; however, this type of movement is not important for more reactive species such as tropospheric ozone because of their reactivity and therefore short atmospheric lifetime. In the Antarctic stratosphere, the reaction that converts reservoir species of chlorine into an active form--which destroys ozone--takes place on the surface of particles in polar stratospheric clouds as the temperature drops below about 200K. This is possible because of the unique isolation of the south polar vortex during the austral winter. The surfaces of these (nitric acid/water) clouds act as catalysts for reactions that release molecular chlorine which quickly photolyzes to chlorine's (radical) active state. It is this radical which destroys ozone.

		<definition>- the combination of a drastic temperature and corresponding pressure drop along with the rotation of the Earth on its axis produces a spinning/rotating volume of air.

Inside the whirling volume of freezing air, the cold temperatures facilitate the condensation of gases into particles that eventually form polar stratospheric clouds. [Colin Baird.

After widespread use of asbestos, over a 15 to 25 year time span, a pattern of illness gradually began to occur in asbestos workers. Three diseases linked to asbestos exposure are asbestosis, a fibrous scarring of the lungs, lung cancer, and mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the chest or abdominal cavity.

		<definition>for carbon regulation, a method of decreasing carbon emissions by setting (annual) regulatory limits on large, industrial CO2 emitters and fining them if they surpass that limit. Emitters that can decrease their annual CO2 emissions are allowed to sell the rights to emit the balance to other emitters which can't as easily decrease emissions. These traded emission right prices are set by the market and, in theory, allow those who need to purchase the emission rights a chance to save money over the fines. Gradually the regulatory emission limits are lowered and this pushes total emissions down over time. A system like this has been in place for sulfur dioxide emissions in the US since the 1990s and for NOx since 2003.

		<definition>A method of capturing carbon dioxide so that it is not released into the atmosphere. This is a proposed response to the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere---mostly from anthropogenic sources since the industrial revolution. It can be achieved chemically in two obvious ways: carbon dioxide can be captured after a fossil fuel has been combusted in either the concentrated exhaust stream or, for example, carbon dioxide can be generated in fuel consumption/precombustion in the so-called syngas (synthesis gas) process which produces molecular hydrogen and CO from a methane-rich feed gas. That mix reacts with high temperature steam to produce H2 and CO2 which is captured. H2 is burned to produce energy. Even more difficult is collecting CO2 from the atmosphere at ambient concentrations in tropospheric air. Carbon dioxide produced by hydrocarbon combustion can be pressurized and injected into old salt mines or used in enhanced oil recovery.

		<definition>ClO2, a radical, undergoes photodecomposition in the stratosphere where the products of this reaction react with ozone. Since this is a photochemical reaction it only takes place while the sun is up. Experiments over Antarctica have shown a direct relation between polar ozone loss and the increase in halocarbon chemistry, which comes from anthropogenic sources. Scientist are currently looking at the molecular behavior of chlorine dioxide in the atmosphere in order to understand its role in depletion of ozone more thoroughly. [Simon, J. D. and Vaida, V.

	<entry term="Chlorine Monoxide">
		<definition>ClO, a radical species (with an odd number of electrons in its outer shell) which plays an important role in the breakdown of stratospheric ozone over Antarctica. Formed by the photolysis of CFCs in the stratosphere and the subsequent destruction of an ozone molecule, these radicals can act as a catalyst in the destruction of ozone while not being destroyed themselves. ClO, reacting with a oxygen atom (present from the Chapman Mechanism), releases a free chlorine radical once again. As a result, one Cl atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules before being sequestered as HCl or another reservoir species (see chlorine nitrate).

		<definition>ClONO2, this is a stratospheric reservoir species for chlorine and nitrogen, two of the catalysts in the breakdown of ozone. Frankly, it is named in a confusing manner; it is formed from the reaction of chlorine monoxide and nitrogen dioxide (not chlorine atoms with nitrate). It reacts with HCl at low temperatures on the surfaces of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs over Antarctica and probably also in the stratosphere over the Arctic). That normally slow reaction heterogeneously produces molecular chlorine and nitric acid. The former outgases from the PSC surface and is quickly photolyzed by 450 nm or shorter wavelength light to form chlorine radicals which rapidly catalyze the breakdown of ozone (see chlorine monoxide).

	<entry term="Chlorine ">
		<definition>Cl2, molecular chlorine. In the stratosphere, atomic (radical) chlorine is very destructive because it depletes the greatly needed ozone layer which protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation from the sun. In the Antarctic stratosphere, molecular chlorine along with nitric acid are formed by the reaction of hydrogen chloride and chlorine nitrate--both stratospheric chlorine reservoir species. This process occurs on polar stratospheric clouds which serve as the reaction sites. Once formed, Cl2vaporizes into the surrounding air as nitric acid--also formed in that process--binds with the ice matrix. Cl2 is then photodissociated in sunlight (lambda &lt;= 450 nm) into chlorine radicals. These chlorine radicals then catalytic destroy ozone. [Graedel, T. E. and Crutzen, Paul J.

Although initially the success of this pesticide to curb human deaths from mosquito-borne malaria was clear, many problems have been associated with the use of DDT. Some of these problems are the bioaccumulation in the food chain especially fish, decline of smaller animals, build-up in animal fatty tissues, endocrine disruption at low concentration, and softening of bird's eggs; however, acute human toxicity of DTT is so low as to be insignificant. In 1973, the U.S. EPA banned all use of DDT in the US; however, it can still be manufactured in the U.S. but only for use in other countries. DDT is still being used extensively in developing countries, and the World Health Organization supports its use in African countries indoors to fight mosquitoes which are carrying malaria. DDT's transport around the globe in the troposphere is confirmed by the detection of DDT and its oxidative degradation products in air samples over the Arctic Ocean.

This practice has had a profound effect on global environmental problems (air pollution, global warming), soil erosion, desertification, sedimentation of water courses, alteration of climate and hydrological cycles, alteration of the atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide balance and has caused many species to become extinct, reducing worldwide biodiversity. A common deforestation practice is to simply burn the forest while clearing the land for a seasonal crop. This also creates a large-scale release of carbon dioxide--while at the same time removing carbon storage in the biosphere--further compounding the global warming effect. Estimates of total mass of carbon annually released into the atmosphere from biomass burning are &gt;2 x 1015 g.

CCl2F2 absorbs UV light in the upper stratosphere where it arrives decades after being released in the troposphere. CFCs, which were originally created by Dupont corporation, were used as refrigerants for everything from air conditioning to home refrigerators because they are non-toxic and extremely unreactive (in the troposphere). It is this unreactivity that makes them such a problem for the atmosphere, because they are able to last long enough to make it to the stratosphere, where they cause so many problems. CCl2F2production, along with all CFCs, has been banned since the mid 1990s, but some scientists believe that the damage has already been done. For further reading see the term ozone.

In the food industry, it is used as an extraction solvent for caffeine, spices, and hops. All of these applications result in the release of dichloromethane into the environment, with the primary sources being the industries that manufacture the chemical or use it in production, such as the plastic and synthetics manufacturers, as well as the electronics industry. Upon release of the liquid chemical into the environment, dichloromethane quickly evaporates to a gas, where it is then degraded by photochemically produced products in the air. Because of its reactivity in the troposphere, it is not believed to react with ozone in the upper atmosphere. Despite its solubility in water, it has low acute toxicity to aquatic animals. In animals (as well as humans), dichloromethane is metabolized into carbon monoxide, which has a higher affinity for the heme groups in hemoglobin than does oxygen and results in deprivation of oxygen. Interestingly, dichloromethane has been found to be an antisickling agent in sickle cell hemoglobin.

		<definition>Also known as ethyl alcohol or alcohol, (C2H5OH) is an oxygenated hydrocarbon that can be burned as a fuel, or blended into gasoline. Thought of as an alternative fuel and clean fuel, ethanol is a renewable energy source that is made from corn or other grains, for instance in Brazil from sugar cane. If blended into gasoline, ethanol helps with the combustion process and therefore less unburned hydrocarbons form. Ethanol blended fuels competed with methyltertbutylether (MTBE), but because of the cost and the fact MTBE can be shipped through existing pipelines, MTBE was chosen. MTBE is now being banned because of its ability to travel in ground water and the bad taste it imparts to drinking water. Because of this, ethanol is once again being put back into gasoline. The process of producing ethanol from grain requires energy. The question is: how much? Furthermore since ethanol is "less energy dense" than gasoline the same volume will produce less energy.

	<entry term="Feedback Cycle">
		<definition>The increase of the input into a system, which produces a negative or a positive output in a system of interlocking components; the return of a part or the effects of the output to the input. A proposed positive feedback cycle involves the outgassing of carbon dioxide from the planet's oceans: Since CO2 solubility in water decreases with temperature and since CO2 is a greenhouse gas, a positive (and possibly runaway) feedback cycle might involve the following: increased greenhouse warming of the atmosphere by IR absorbing CO2 in the gas phase--and the subsequent heating of the oceans--could increase the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from the oceans. This might thereby increase greenhouse warming, which would, in turn, again heat the atmosphere and the ocean, etc. This is an amplification of the input: positive feedback: leads to more warming. Though the process is no doubt more complicated than this, a runaway greenhouse effect is usually given as the reason for Venus' high surface temperatures so a planet-wide process of this type is not unknown. Conversely, a negative feedback cycle might consist of the increase in release of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) by ocean surface microorganisms whose population is increased by ocean warming. DMS oxidation in the troposphere leads to sulfate aerosol formation which act as cloud condensation nuclei in the marine troposphere. Increased CCN would increase cloud albedo which increases reflect incoming solar radiation, thereby cooling the oceans. This is an dampening of the input: negative feedback: leads to termination of the original warming.

		<definition>The phenomenon in which outgoing infrared radiation that would normally exit from a planet's atmosphere but instead, is trapped or reflected because of the presence of the atmosphere and its components (see below) is called the greenhouse effect. It has been calculated that this effect is necessary to maintain the earth's climate and surface temperature and, more importantly, the liquid state of water in the majority of the earth's biosphere; however, the best scientific estimates to date suggest that increasing amounts of greenhouse gases are resulting in higher temperatures worldwide. This could result in melting of icecaps that would raise the sea level and cause devastating floods in coastal areas, more extremes in rainfall and intensity, and the distribution of species in the biosphere. [The Greenhouse Effect; Matthew Kreljic, ed.; 1992; HW Wilson Co.; New York.] [Climatic Change; v20: p. iii-vii: 1992.]</definition>

	<entry term="Greenhouse Gases">
		<definition>Those atmospheric components that absorb strongly in the infrared region of the spectrum. Infrared radiation is reflected and emitted by the earth's surface as heat and causes a fairly large warming effect when trapped by these gases in the atmosphere. In order of abundance and importance as greenhouse gases are water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, nitrous oxide, methane, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The U.S. EPA provides a tool for mapping CO2 equivalents emission in the United States-for all those greenhouse gases except water-here. Absorption by water vapor, the most common greenhouse gas, explains why many humid or cloudy days feel much hotter than dry, clear days of the same air temperature. Because of these gases, only about 5% of the radiation escapes from the atmosphere while more than 90% is radiated back to the surface of the earth. [Geoderma; v135; 49-62; 2006.]</definition>

		<definition>The Gulf Stream is a powerful current in the Atlantic Ocean. Its movement is related to density redistribution, differences in temperature, the Earth's rotation, and wind currents. Beginning in the Gulf of Mexico, it flows along the east coast of North America and across the Atlantic to Europe. The Gulf Stream carries warm water from the tropics and warms the climate of the land near where it passes. The relatively temperate weather in Great Britain is, to a large degree, controlled by the Gulf Stream redistributing energy from equatorial solar radiation to the North Atlantic.

		<definition>Sandstorms that occur in the deserts. As a thunderstorm is ending there is a decrease in water droplet fall. The desert's air is extremely dry and able to evaporate the water as winds rush towards the desert's surface. As winds continue to hit the surface they form a circular wind pattern containing sand which increases in force and speed to form the sandstorm. In the summer of 2011 a haboob hit Phoenix Arizona USA that was 100 miles wide and a mile high. Sandstorms blowing west off Africa take phosphate out towards the Atlantic Ocean and sometimes even as far as South America. This phosphate may be an important source of phosphorus in phosphorus-limited biomes. [Williams, T.; New York Times, Jul. 6, 2011.][U. Brunner and R.

	<entry term="Hadley Circulation">
		<definition>proposed by George Hadley in 1735, it is the tropical convection system that describes the atmospheric thermal circulation of air from the equator (0 degrees latitude) poleward to 30 degrees both north and south of the equator. When saturated air at the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), located approximately at the equator, is heated, convergence and convection causes it to rise into the upper atmosphere, creating an area of low pressure at the earth's surface. As the pocket of saturated air at the ITCZ rises, it cools, releasing large amounts of precipitation. Rather than remaining in the tropics, the air then flows horizontally towards the higher latitudes. At approximately 30 degrees both north and south of the equator, the pocket of air in the upper atmosphere has sufficiently mixed and cooled enough to return to the surface. To complete the circle, the area of low pressure at the equator pulls air in from the higher latitudes.

Examples are the multi-ringed aromatic compounds created in urban environments and condensed on urban particulates. Samples of the desired media (air, water, etc.) are dissolved in solution and then separated by injecting the solution into mobile phase solution which is separated via interaction with a stationary phase. As the solution passes through the stationary phase, the components are separated based upon different partitioning behaviors between the components in the mobile phase and the stationary phase. This allows each component to be analyzed separately as they pass through the detector. [Journal of the Association for Laboratory Automation; v10; 381-393; 2005.]</definition>

		<definition>HCFCs, chemical species slated to replace CFCs in the near future in most Western nations. When the normal chlorofluorocarbons (see above) reach the stratosphere and are photo-decomposed, their released chlorine radicals destroy the natural ozone that acts as our umbrella to shield the Earth from ultraviolet radiation (see chlorine and ozone). With one or more hydrogen-carbon bonds, HCFCs are still useful as replacement for CFCs in most applications. However, this bonding structure makes HCFCs much more chemically unstable--as compared to CFCs--and therefore subject to hydroxyl radical and ozone attack early in their gas phase career in the atmosphere. In fact they react in the troposphere instead of the stratosphere. Their atmospheric lifetime is shorter than CFCs and they, therefore, have a smaller chance of reaching the stratosphere where their chlorine could be released by destructive photolysis and enter the catalytic ozone destruction cycle.

Both the liquid and the vapor can cause severe burns to all parts of the body, and medical treatment is required for all exposures. In fact, HF burns covering only 2% of the body can be fatal. If this chemical comes in contact with glass, concrete and other silicon-containing materials, it yields silicon tetrafluoride gas. In general, this chemical is used to produce environmentally safer fluorocarbon products, chemical derivatives, and fluoropolymers. Environmentally speaking, hydrofluoric acid is much too reactive to ever reach the upper atmosphere, and tropospheric sources therefore do not interfere with the ozone layer. Hydrogen fluoride, however, is produced in situ in the stratosphere by the photolytic destruction of anthropogenic CFCs. And while this process also frees atomic chlorine which catalytically destroys ozone, Cl can be sequestered as HCl, and temporarily removed from the O3 destruction cycle. Analogously HF also forms but unlike the chlorine reservoir species HCl which is eventually broken apart by hydroxyl radical, HF is too stable for th OH dot attack, and so the only significant stratospheric sink is eventual diffusion into the troposphere.

However, halogen radicals such as atomic bromine and atomic chlorine (released from anthropogenic and some natural sources) catalyze the breakdown of ozone which results in a net ozone loss: O3 + Br ----&gt; BrO + O2 A reservoir species is a compound whose formation breaks the destruction cycle by taking the halogen radical out of the cycle. Two examples are HCl and HBr. Unfortunately, the success of HBr as a reservoir species is very limited due to the fact that it, unlike HCl, photodissociates quickly and easily. Thus, the ozone depleting effects of bromine are, atom for atom, more severe than those of chlorine. [Graedel, T.D. and P. Crutzen.

	<entry term="Iridescent Clouds ">
		<definition>Clouds that appear in a swirl of various colors. As a cloud of this nature forms it is composed of small droplets which are almost entirely uniformly spread; however this may change as the cloud grows. When the sunlight interacts with these droplets, and at a greater angle from the sun (for instance, sunrise or sunset but with the sun often hidden behind other clouds), solar radiation is scattered by the small droplets. This scattering occurs for different wavelengths approximately equally. That is why these thin clouds appear in a swirl of rainbow colors.

	<entry term="Isoprene ">
		<definition>C5H5, a colorless volatile liquid which is insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol, and very reactive because of its low vapor pressure and double bonds. From an atmospheric chemistry point of view, isoprene is emitted from trees and plants, globally on the order of teragrams (500 x 1012 g) per year. This reactive, natural hydrocarbon may influence the oxidative/reductive balance in the biosphere where its concentrations are significant, in regions such as rainforests and large temporal forests. Most isoprene is directly emitted into the atmosphere from plant surfaces and some no doubt condenses on particulate matter. Emission rates from trees are positively correlated with leaf temperature and therefore, to a degree, time of day. Ultimately the carbon in isoprene is oxidized to carbon monoxide and finally carbon dioxide.

In atmospheric chemistry, long lived isotopes such as carbon-14 (14C) are used to determine the age of objects that contained living matter. Other isotopes are used to track the routes of air parcels in the atmosphere. [Science; v266; 1584-1586; 1994.] [Dictionary of Science; R.K.

These data demonstrated that atmospheric carbon dioxide gas concentrations were increasing in the atmosphere and not just being absorbed by the ocean and plants. Atmospheric carbon dioxide gas phase concentration is lower during the spring when plants take up carbon dioxide and higher in the winter when the majority of plants are conserving energy, growing slower, and fallen plants are decaying and thus causing a rising fluctuation of carbon dioxide.

	<entry term="Lapse Rate">
		<definition>The rate of decrease of temperature with increasing altitude in the atmosphere. If heat is neither gained nor lost from the air parcel under consideration, then the lapse rate is said to be adiabatic. For air parcels of differing water content this value is different. In the troposphere, these two values are generally inversely proportional: increasing altitude means a lower temperature until the tropopause is reached. When altitude increases and temperature decreases, the lapse rate is considered positive, and for unsaturated tropospheric air this is approximately 9.8 degrees C/km; however, in an inversion layer the atmospheric lapse rate is negative, that is, the atmosphere's temperature warms with increasing altitude.

		<definition>Mercury is a toxic heavy metal released into the atmosphere, most significantly, through the burning of coal in coal-fired power plants and from Hg-cell chloralkali plants where Hg acts as a flowing electrode used to reduce Na+ to Na0 in an amalgam. While levels of mercury in the atmosphere aren't directly toxic, mercury deposition into lakes and rivers leads to elevated levels of mercury in these organisms, which can eventually be transmitted to humans through the eating of fish and other organisms which bioaccumulate Hg and other toxic heavy metals. Long range transport has moved this element---released in combustion processes---to all of the continents on the planet. Mercury is methylated biochemically in the biosphere into a much more toxic form, methyl mercury, CH3HgX, where X can be variously -CH3, -OH, or -Cl or other halogens.

	<entry term="Methane ">
		<definition>CH4, a colorless, odorless, flammable, greenhouse gas. It is the simplest of all hydrocarbons with a formula of CH4. Methane is released naturally into the air from anaerobic environments such as marshes, swamps, and rice fields, and from symbiotic microbes in the guts of ruminant animals (such as cattle, sheep, and camels), and sewage sludge. Methane is released from methane producing bacteria (methanogens) that live in these anaerobic places. Methanogens in termite guts are the source of methane released by termites. The discovery that termites may be a significant source of atmospheric methane is attributed to work by Patrick Zimmerman and his research group members at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder Colorado (see reference immediately below and papers in the scientific literature). Ice core data from the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica show that present atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 are the highest in the past 800,000 years as determined in the so-called Dome C ice core.

		<definition>This may be a significant component of atmospheric aerosol particles that form from the atmospheric oxidation of dimethylsulfide (DMS), when this DMS is produced by phytoplankton. These aerosol particles can lead to the formation of cloud condensation nuclei, water droplet formation, and hence clouds and storm formation. This therefore may contribute to the turbulent mixing of oceanic surface waters and subsequent upwelling of nutrients that feed those microorganisms (a positive feedback cycle). It is thought that increased emissions of dimethylsulfide, and subsequent methanesulfonic acid over the oceans from an increase in sea water temperature may have a negative feedback on global warming by increasing cloud formation; although the net effect of clouds on global warming is very unclear at this point.

		<definition>CH3Br, this halocarbon is released, to a degree, naturally from the oceans, but is more commonly released from its anthropogenic use as a soil fumigant or pesticide. Methyl bromide is persistent enough to reach the stratosphere where it photochemically decomposes to yield atomic bromine (radical) and proceeds to destroy stratospheric ozone in the same manner as the atomic chlorine radical. On an atom-for-atom basis, stratospheric bromine is more efficient at destroying ozone than is chlorine because the HBr reservoir species is more photochemically active than HCl; however, there is much less of hydrogen bromide in the stratosphere. Recent data suggest that since 1998 atmospheric concentrations have dropped 13% due the CH3Br use limitations mandated by the Montreal Protocol [New York Times Aug. 16, 2003] [Baird, Colin.

	<entry term="Mie Scattering">
		<definition>Processes by which particles of similar size and electrical characteristics separate or disperse different wavelengths (read colors) of light. First described by Gustav Mie in 1808. Since the sun's visible spectrum contains a mixture of (traditionally ordered) red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet colors, these wavelengths are differentially scattered by particles as they travel through the atmosphere. Red--longer wavelength--light is scattered not much and blue--shorted wavelength--light is scattered much more. This is why the sky appears blue: the sun's blue light is scattered back towards your eyes from atmospheric particles so when you look up--that is, away from the sun, the light you see is light scattered to your eye from atmospheric particles. (You might ask yourself why the sky--viewed at an off angle from the sun--isn't black instead of blue.) Mie scattering is also the reason why sunsets appear red: the sun's red light is NOT scattered as much as blue light by atmospheric particles and so solar blue light is scattered away from your eyes on its way from the sun and red light is scattered less. The result is that more solar red light hits your eyes than blue and sunsets appear red. Notice also that the redness of sunsets increases at the amount of atmospheric particles between you and the sun increase, that is as the sun "goes down" mie scattering increases as the amount of particles between you and the sun increases.

		<definition>(methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, C9H7MnO3) an organometallic compound sold as a gasoline additive. It is added to gasoline--just as tetraethyl lead, the chemical it replaces, was--to enhance the gasoline's octane thereby increasing burning characteristics, lowering engine wear, and raising gas mileage. It was banned by the US Clean Air Act from 1977 to 1995. After 1995, up to 1/32 g Mn as MMT/gallon gasoline could be sold in gasoline in the US; however, U.S. gasoline formulators use of MMT is small. This organo-metallic compound has been found to be toxic to humans at the concentration experienced by workers in, for instance, an industrial setting where high concentrations are used (and spilled), but apparently not in airborne concentrations, such as car emissions where the final manganese forms are as the phosphate, sulfate, and oxide produced during internal combustion by the engine. Symptoms of acute MMT exposure range from skin and eye irritation to liver damage to neurological damage.

		<definition>the compound methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) was blended in gasoline originally in 1979 to serve as an oxygenate. This would theoretically cause the combustion process in internally combustion engines to be more complete. This effort to improve air quality by producing a fuel that was more readily oxidized and decrease the resulting tropospheric ozone production was somewhat effective. A problem arises, however, in the fact that MTBE moves extremely well in water (it may actually move upstream because of its high affinity for water molecules), causes fish kills due to its toxicity to fish, and even at low concentrations, it can render large surface or groundwater sources to be useless. Its use has since been banned in California.

Nitric acid is highly water soluble. This solubility with water allows easy removal of nitric acid from the troposphere by atmospheric precipitation. Commonly, this is referred to as acid rain or snow. Nitric acid has a relatively low concentration in the atmosphere but provides an important role in the production of sulfuric acid. It acts as a catalyst in the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid.

		<definition>- In the event of a significant nuclear war, researchers (Paul Crutzen and John Birks initially) predicted that a barrier of smoke (from incinerated urban centers and forests) would fill tropospheric skies--and punch oxides of nitrogen and bomb debris into the stratosphere. Tropospheric smoke would---depending on the extent of the exchange---eventually surround the earth, reducing the tropospheric temperature and causing damage to ecosystems and atmospheric components such as stratospheric ozone. Others have calculated the size of nuclear explosions that are required to get bomb debris into the stratosphere: at mid to high latitudes where the tropopause is lower only 30 kiloton weapons are required; the U.S. atomic bombs used during the Second World War averaged less than 18 kilotons. At low latitudes, where the tropopause is highest, &gt;1 megaton weapons are required to loft bomb debris into the stratosphere.

	<entry term="Ozone Destruction">
		<definition>- In addition to photolytic destruction by infrared light (wavelengths of 1140 nanometers or less), stratospheric ozone is destroyed by interaction with a variety of chemical substances in the stratosphere. Some of these chemicals, such as the chlorine free radical--liberated by the photolysis of chlorofluorocarbons, are not normally produced there in nature at such high concentrations. This leads to the conclusion that human activities, and not natural chemical cycles, are responsible for the current rate of stratospheric ozone destruction. Ozone destruction is most noticeable (alarmingly!) over the South Pole, where seasonal plummeting in stratospheric ozone concentrations have been measured since the 1970s and are apparently still increasing (1999). That said, estimates based on declining CFC use (because of the Montreal Protocol) suggest that the damage to the global ozone layer will max out soon in the 21st century and that that ozone damage will decrease within the next 75 to 100 years.

If one of these O radicals encounters an oxygen molecule, it can bond to produce ozone. This reaction is only stable if another molecule is present to absorb the excess energy released as the oxygen radical and molecule bond. This is a called a three body reaction, and the third body exhibits its removal of the excess energy by whizzing off at a higher energy and thereby increasing the temperature of the atmosphere where this reaction occurs.

	<entry term="Ozone Hole">
		<definition>The ozone hole refers to the total amount of ozone in the atmosphere over Antarctica that was discovered to be decreasing at an alarming rate. The hole was discovered over an observation site in Antarctica by J.C. Farman, B.G. Gardiner and J.D. Shanklin. There is extensive evidence showing that chlorine originating from a class of synthetic compounds, the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), is responsible for the destruction of the ozone layer. CFCs are molecules that contain one or more atoms of both chlorine and fluorine. In September of 2006, the ozone hole over Antarctica was the largest area ever recorded and was almost THREE times larger than the area of the U.S. Because CFCs are so unreactive, they do not break down when released into the air in the troposphere where they are spilled. In time, air currents and diffusion carry them into the stratosphere, where, under the influence of UV radiation, they release chlorine radicals that initiate the destruction of ozone. Data collected by NASA have shown, conclusively, that there is an inverse relationship between ozone concentration and the chlorine monoxide radical in the stratosphere;ClO is formed by chlorine atom attack on O3. CFCs are very useful inert, nontoxic, nonflammable compounds that had been used for years as coolants and as spray can propellants for aerosol forms of hair sprays and deodorants. They had been unsurpassed as solvents for cleaning electronic microcircuits. Commercially, the most important CFCs are the halogenated methanes, Freon-11 (trichlorofluoromethane) and Freon-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane). Over 50% of asthma inhalers containchlorofluorocarbons as the solvent and gaseous propellent. These CFCs have relatively recently been prohibited in all products except in those medicinal inhaler dispensers for asthmatics and a few other limited exceptions. In Finland alone there are over a million medicinal dispensers that disperse freons into the atmosphere. This is equal to the freon concentration of the cooling devices in approximately l00,000 refrigerators. [Buell and Girard, Chemistry, Prentice-Hall, Inc., l994.] [Journal of Physical Chemistry A; v101; 7350-58; 1997.] See Antarctic Ozone Hole for much more.</definition>

In atmospheric chemistry these become volume parts of analyte per volume parts of atmosphere: ppmv, ppbv, etc. At low analyte gas phase concentrations the analyte is assumed to act as an ideal gas. For instance, a 1 ppmv concentration of formaldehyde would represent 1 liter of formaldehyde per every 1,000,000 liters of air; also equivalent to 1 microliter of H2CO per 1 L air. In gas phase concentrations these units are also called gas phase mixing ratios. The reason is because they are just that, ratios of analyte volume to sample volume; the volume of the sample doesn't matter. [Ecology A to Z; P.

	<entry term="Photic Zone">
		<definition>In the ocean (or in lakes) this is the area near the surface with enough light to support photosynthesis. In this zone, both the chemical and biological activity can be enhanced by penetrating solar radiation. This zone is about 20 meters in depth in the ocean. In the upper surface of this zone, the marine photochemistry is most vigorous. Changes in the ultraviolet light content penetrating this region because of changes in the UV-blocking ability of the ozone layer may create unexpected biological results there.

	<entry term="Photochemical Smog">
		<definition>Natural and artificially emitted hydrocarbons in the presence of oxides of nitrogen undergo photochemical reactions which produce a cloud of toxic chemicals including ozone and a variety of harmful chemical gaseous and particulate agents. This process is powered by sunlight and some of the products, such as ozone, reach a peak soon after photon flux from the sun reaches a maximum, around midday. The thermal inversions often associated with some cities can lead to a dangerous buildup of smog in urban areas. Human deaths have been attributed to photochemical smog since the Industrial Revolution in cities such as London and New York. [Science; v.241; 1473; 1988.] [Atmospheric Environment.

	<entry term="Photostationary State ">
		<definition>This describes a condition in which there is equilibrium in a photochemical reaction. For this condition to take place the rate of photodissociation or rate of chemical reaction of one or more of the reactants has to be equal to the rate of their recombination or reformation. The reactions producing ozone in the atmosphere under certain conditions are described this way. For instance, the three important tropospheric reaction involving the formation and consumption of ozone are: O3 + NO -------&gt; O2 + NO2 (ozone consumption by NO) NO2 + hv -------&gt; O + NO (NO2 photolysis) O2 + O ----M---&gt; O3 (ozone formation) At night in the clean troposphere, the concentration of NO is very low and so O3 consumption is very slow, and therefore ozone's concentration stays relatively constant overnight even though ozone is no longer being produced. Likewise in polluted, urban settings at night, as before, ozone is no longer being produced but NO's concentration at the end of the day can be quite high, and so O3 in that setting can be completely destroyed overnight. There are, therefore, some concentrations of NO, NO2, sunlight, and O3 that would interact according to the equations above--and given tropospheric reaction rates and sunlight intensities--would yield a constant concentration of ozone. This would be the photostationary state concentration of ozone; however, it is important to note that this concentration--if no other reagents are considered and at normal tropospheric temperatures and sunlight intensities--is too low to account for the common ground-level ozone concentrations routinely found in polluted cites like Houston, Texas or Beijing, China. Instead, there must be other means of NO oxidation to NO2 besides oxidation by ozone ocurring to produce the O3levels that are wide spread in highly polluted environments. And there are: peroxy compounds like methyl peroxy radical, hydroperoxy radical, and other volatile organic compounds are also involved in reactions that yield ozone in cities all over the planet.

PCBs are released into the atmosphere through the incomplete combustion of fuel or the processing of old electrical transformers or capacitors and are particularly long-lived, with atmospheric destruction of PCBs usually caused by reaction with OH radicals. The ultraviolet wavelengths that destroy PCBs do not make it to the troposphere because they are blocked by the ozone layer, but photolysis can occur in the upper atmosphere. Bioprocessing by organisms in soil and water is a much more common, though very slow destruction route for PCBs. PCBs have been found in some organism on all the earth's continents.

		<definition>Establishing the relative age of various materials with the use of carbon-14. This involves measuring the amount of 14C and of 12C and comparing the measured ratio to the one established by the production of 14C in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays. When an organism is alive, the 14C/ 12C ratio in its biomass is constant (because of constant atmospheric 14C production, diffusion to the lower atmosphere, absorption and incorporation by organisms, and because of constant 14C radioactive decay); however, when the organism dies, the ratio begins to change---at a very predictable rate---because the (dead) organism is no longer incorporating new carbon. Therefore knowing the carbon-14/carbon-12 ratio now in some artifact gives a very good measure of how long the carbon has been "dead." The object however must obviously have organic material either in it or on it for this dating method to work. Also the length of time one can "look back" in time is limited because the amount of carbon-14 must be detected with some certainty for the age to be known with confidence, and the longer the sample has been dead the less14C is present because it is continually decaying.

	<entry term="Rainout ">
		<definition>The process of the removal of atmospheric constituents by precipitation. One item necessary for a rain drop to form is a condensation nucleus. Pollutants in the air such as nitric acid and sulfuric acid form nucleation sites (particles) upon which water vapor often condenses and forms a droplet. As these droplets grow they collect more moisture and may ultimately fall out as precipitation. This accounts for some of the acid rain deposition on the planet's surface and a means by which atmospheric aerosols, gases, and particles are removed.

Shorter visible wavelengths, such as blue, are scattered by smaller particles than are the longer wavelengths like red.

	<entry term="Reaction Rate">
		<definition>The speed of chemical reactions is expressed as a rate of change in the concentration of a participating species with respect to time. The reaction rates of chemical species in the atmosphere are extremely important parameters when considering sources and sinks of gas-phase components. For instance, the reaction rate for the reaction of hydroxyl radical with atmospheric propane in the troposphere is very fast, yielding an alkyl radical that goes through a series of reactions to yield ozone in urban environments. Conversely the reaction rate of propane with the nitrate radical ("NO3 dot") is ~10,000 times slower under the same conditions. Therefore, just considering these two chemical sinks, hydroxyl controls propane's lifetime in urban settings.[Evaluated Kinetic Data; International Union of Pure Applied Chemistry; 2008.] [Crutzen, Paul J. and Graedel, T.E.

		<definition>This is the ratio between the actual water vapor content of the atmosphere and the maximum water vapor content possible at that given temperature. If the temperature of a given parcel of air rises, the amount of moisture it can hold increases and as such its relative humidity decreases. If there is no change in temperature but the moisture content decreases then the relative humidity will again decrease because the ratio of actual water vapor present is less than the maximum amount the air could hold. Conversely, if the water content does not change but the temperature falls, the relative humidity increases until saturation and possible precipitation occurs.

		<definition>A short-lived, high amplitude discharge of electricity that accompanies a cloud-to-ground lightning event. The bright lightning flash that is visible to the human eye is actually composed of extremely rapid electric discharges called strokes. The return stoke follows a downward extending leader, or conductive path of ionized air. The electrons in the cloud flow down this conductive pathway toward the surface of the earth. As electrons continually migrate down the path, electrons remaining higher up on the path in the cloud begin to consecutively move down the channel to the surface. Since the path of electron flow is progressively lengthened upward, the discharge of the elevated electrons high in the cloud to a lower place in the cloud and then down the pathway to the ground is called the return stroke.

	<entry term="Rule of 90">
		<definition>The systematic numbering system originally created by the Du Pont Chemical Company in the early 1930s, which is now the standard method in the naming of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Chlorofluorocarbons, such as dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2), and trichlorofluorocarbon (CCl3F), were given the nicknames CFC-12 and CFC-11, respectively, by Du Pont so that they could be remembered more easily. In order to derive the chemical structure of a chlorofluorocarbon from its common name, the rule of 90 states that you would add 90 to the number at the end of the name. In the case of CFC-12, add 90+12 to get 102. The hundreds place, the one in this example, represents the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. The tens place, the 0, represents the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule, and the ones place represents the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule. According to the rule of 90, CFC-12 has 1 carbon atom, 0 hydrogen atoms, and 2 fluorine atoms. The final aspect of the rule of 90 pertains to the necessity of carbon to form four bonds. If, after assigning hydrogen and fluorine atoms to it, the carbon atom still requires more bonds to reach the required four, those bonds will be to chlorine atoms. So far, the one carbon atom of CFC-12 has only formed two bonds, both with fluorine atoms. Thus the remaining two bonds must be chlorine atoms. Analogously, CFC-11's chemical formula is CCl3F.

	<entry term="Runaway Greenhouse Effect">
		<definition>This describes and explains the difference in the surface temperatures between the Earth (average surface temperature 15 C) and Venus (450 C). Note that Venus is not this temperature because of its proximity to the sun. This phenomenon on Venus is caused by a high atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, which in turn cause overheating of the planet. The runaway effect causes a permanence in the warming of the planet at the surface. On Venus, the loss of liquid water from evaporation and subsequent photolysis of H2O and loss of atomic H to space in the planet's early life caused the buildup of carbon dioxide in Venus' atmosphere. Since CO2 is a greenhouse gas, it absorbs the infrared radiation reflected from the planet's surface, which heats the atmosphere and prevents the removal of CO2 by rain out and depositional processes that capture CO2 as carbonates.

	<entry term="Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate">
		<definition>This is the lapse rate (the rate of change of the temperature in the gases in the atmosphere along different altitudes) of a mass of moist air as it rises in the atmosphere. This rate begins to slow as the dew point is reached and condensation forms. This rate of cooling goes from 4 degrees C/km all the way to 9 degrees C/km depending on humidity. Contrast with the dry adiabatic lapse rate which is 9.8 degrees C per km of rise. The saturated lapse rate is always less than the dry rate because the lapse rate (cooling) is less for air that contains water vapor which releases its latent heat as it cools, suppressing the cooling.

Smog occurs when high concentrations of moisture is combined with smoke (often containing oxides of sulfur and nitrogen) in the presence of high temperatures or thermal inversions and the absence of wind. These conditions cause polluted air to stagnate over industrial or urban areas and can create a respiratory health hazard. Large coastal industrial centers with surrounding high ground are more prone to smog.

	<entry term="Solar Radiation">
		<definition>This is electromagnetic radiation (light energy) emitted by the sun. This energy is transmitted through space in the units of electromagnetic energy called photons. The strength of the solar energy that reaches our outer atmosphere is called the solar constant and has a value of approximately 2.0 calories per minute per square centimeter. Roughly one-half (1.0 cal min-1 cm-2) of all the solar radiation that enters the upper atmosphere is available at the earth's surface. Of the fifty percent loss, approximately 32 percent is reflected back into space by either clouds, dust, or aerosols; the remaining 18 percent is absorbed by clouds, dust, water, and atmospheric gases. The short high-energy wavelengths that are absorbed by the Earth are re-radiated at longer, lower energy wavelengths mostly in the IR wavelength region. These lower-energy wavelengths are, in part, prevented from escaping into space by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Solar radiation is the fuel source that provides a mechanism for all biological processes on earth. Without solar radiation, life on earth would not exist. (This statement, of course, neglects the contribution to the earth's surface temperature from radioactive decay in the earth.)

A second type of stratospheric cloud, called a polar stratospheric cloud (PSC), occurs in the polar regions during winter and early spring. Polar stratospheric clouds are of particular interest to scientists studying the Antarctic Ozone Hole. Polar stratospheric clouds form under extremely cold conditions, whereby nitric acid, water vapor and other trace chemicals freeze to form ice crystals. PSCs provide a solid surface on which chlorine-containing reservoir compounds can gather, and on this surface the chemical reactions involved in the depletion of ozone are greatly increased.

	<entry term="Stratospheric Ozone">
		<definition>This is also called the ozone layer, where ozone concentrations are as high as 10 parts per million, and is a vitally important region of the atmosphere. This layer of ozone is located approximately 20-50 kilometers above the earth's surface. Stratospheric ozone is important because it prevents most of the high-energy ultraviolet solar radiation from reaching the earth's surface. Photodissociation, a photochemical process, is responsible for the formation of the protective ozone layer in the stratosphere. In the upper atmosphere, diatomic oxygen absorbs high-energy ultraviolet radiation. The absorption of radiation causes the diatomic oxygen molecule to break forming two oxygen radicals. The oxygen radical can then recombine with other diatomic oxygen molecules to form triatomic oxygen, or ozone. In the middle regions of the stratosphere, ozone is found in concentrations as high as 10 parts per million. Ozone can also form in the lower portions of the troposphere, due to anthropogenic activity and by a completely different mechanism. Without the protective stratospheric ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, life (as we know it) on earth would not be possible.

Stratus clouds are low clouds, and as the root word suggests they are layered in appearance. They occur in broad sheets across most or all of the sky. Generally their formation is due to condensation within layered air that is not subjected to strong vertical movement.

	<entry term="Sulfur Dioxide">
		<definition>SO2-This is a colorless gas consisting of a single sulfur atom and two oxygen atoms. Sulfur dioxide is a major primary pollutant in the atmosphere originating mostly from coal fired power plants and other fossil fuels combustion. In the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide is usually oxidized by ozone and hydrogen peroxide to form sulfur trioxide, a secondary pollutant. Sulfur trioxide, similar to sulfur dioxide, is extremely soluble in water. If these sulfur oxides are present in the atmosphere when condensation occurs, droplets of sulfuric acid (acid rain) are formed. Volcanic eruptions provide a natural source of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere. However the real problem associated with the production of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere is not with the sulfur dioxide expelled by volcanoes. Anthropogenic production of sulfur dioxide, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is largely responsible for damage caused by acid rain.

		<definition>In the atmosphere sulfur oxides (see sulfur dioxide) are converted to sulfuric acid. Oxides of sulfur and nitrogen combine with atmospheric moisture to produce acid rain. Although some sulfur oxides are introduced into the atmosphere by natural means, such as volcanic eruptions, the majority of the sulfur oxides responsible for the damaging effects of acid rain come from anthropogenic sources, mainly the burning of fossil fuels. Areas in the northeastern United States , easternCanada , and northern Europe have suffered damage due to the effects of acid rain. In many areas damage to forests, crops, lakes, and streams are so severe that they are completely devoid of any life forms. Steps are now being taken in many parts of the world to reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide introduced into the atmosphere. In 1990, amendments where made to the Clean Air Act that places restrictions on the release of sulfur dioxides by power plants. The amendment calls for the reduction of sulfur emissions from a 1990 level of nearly 20 million tons per year to approximately 10 million tons per year by January 1, 2000.

	<entry term="Summer Solstice">
		<definition>In the Northern Hemisphere occurs on about June 21 of each year. The summer solstice is the longest day of the year and marks the beginning of the summer season. If the earth's axis were not tilted in relation to the plane of earth's orbit around the sun (the ecliptic) there would be no seasonal changes on earth. Butbecause the earth's axis is tilted in relationship to its plane of orbit around the sun (~23.5 degrees) and assumes a constant direction--with the North Pole pointing towards the North Star, seasons occur, and daylight hours can fluctuate in length. Each day prior to the summer solstice the sun appears farther north in the sky; but at the summer solstice, the sun reaches its most northerly position in the sky, directly above the Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees north latitude. Following the summer solstice the sun moves farther south in the sky, and on about September 23 it is directly overhead at the equator (the fall equinox).

	<entry term="Temperature Inversion ">
		<definition>The abnormal reversal of temperature in the troposphere caused by meteorological conditions. This leads to the entrapment of urban air pollution because mixing of surface air into the rest of the troposphere is limited. Under normal circumstances, air in the troposphere is cold at high altitudes and warm at low altitudes, or near the earth's surface. (See lapse rate.) When air pollutants, such as O3, SO2 or NOx, in urban areas get too concentrated, smog is produced. This can lead to human health disturbances in people with respiratory illnesses such as asthma. Surface temperature inversions are created when the lapse rate goes negative, that is, when the temperature profile of low lying tropospheric air increases with altitude. Air at the earth's surface is trapped there because the air above it is less warmer and less dense. This can be disastrous for the air quality in urban areas when anthropogenic pollutants are not mixed away from the surface and, instead, build up. In London, England in 1952, 4,000 people died during a four-day temperature inversion event in December. In Donora, Pennsylvania in 1948 a five-day temperature inversion trapped smog---made of soot, SO2, and metal fumes from a zinc works---that killed 20 people. [Alden, Robert.

		<definition>(TCE) C2HCl3, this is an industrial solvent used primarily for vapor degreasing and cold cleaning. It is an extraction solvent for greases, oils, fats, waxes, and tars, and is used by the textile processing industry to sour cotton, wool, and other fabrics. Exposure to moderate amounts of trichloroethylene may cause various health effects such as headaches, vertigo, visual disturbance, tremors, and dizziness. Death may occur from inhalation of large amounts. People located near or downwind of sites where TCE may be in operation might be exposed to higher levels. It is a human carcinogen.

	<entry term="Trichlorofluoromethane ">
		<definition>(Freon®-11, CFC-12) One of the principal greenhouse gases, a gas with absorption bands in the infrared portion of the spectrum. There is extensive evidence showing that a class of synthetic compounds, the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), are responsible for the destruction of the ozone layer. CFCs are molecules that contain one or more atoms of both chlorine and fluorine. In September of 2004, the ozone hole over Antarctica was the largest area ever recorded and was almost THREE times larger than the area of the U.S. Because CFCs are so unreactive, they do not break down when released into the air in the troposphere where they are spilled. In time, air currents and diffusion carry them into the stratosphere, where, under the influence of UV radiation, they release chlorine radicals that initiate the destruction of ozone. Data collected by NASA have shown conclusively, that there is an inverse relationship between ozone concentration and the chlorine monoxide radical in the stratosphere; ClO is formed by chlorine atom attack on O3. CFCs are very useful inert, nontoxic, nonflammable compounds that had been used for years as coolants and as spray can propellants for aerosol forms of hair sprays and deodorants. They had been unsurpassed as solvents for cleaning electronic microcircuits. Commercially, the most important CFCs are the halogenated methanes, Freon-11 (trichlorofluoromethane) and Freon-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane). Over 50% of asthma inhalers contain chlorofluorocarbons as the solvent and gaseous propellent. These CFCs have relatively recently been prohibited in all products except in those medicinal inhaler dispensers for asthmatics and a few other limited exceptions. In Finland alone there are over a million medicinal dispensers that disperse freons into the atmosphere. This is equal to the freon concentration of the cooling devices in approximately l00,000 refrigerators. [Buell and Girard, Chemistry, Prentice-Hall, Inc., l994.] [Chemosphere; v24; 935-940; 1992.] [Chemical Physics Letters; v427; 241-245; 2006.]</definition>

	<entry term="Tundra ">
		<definition>A high-latitude biome composed of limited biodiversity. Because of the colder temperatures compared to lower latitudes, plants are limited to small bushes, grasses, mosses, and lichens and almost no trees. Mostly below freezing, the temperature in the summer in the tundra can go above zero and cause partial thawing of the upper layers above the permafrost (frozen soil and dead plant stuff) for only a few days or weeks per year. Lots of carbon is stored in the thick mats in tundra layers for hundreds and thousands of years and, if long term temperature of the earth's tundra increases then biological degradation can cause the release of carbon in the form of methane or carbon dioxide. A fire in 2007 in Alaska released large amounts of this type of stored carbon. It's realistic to assume that tundral fires might increase if the earth's temperature warms--warming that recent widely measured temperatures and atmospheric modeling show occurs more at higher latitudes rather than lower--and so tundral fires can increase overtime. This would be a positive feedback cycle since this released carbon would contribute to global warming.

		<definition>This fuel consists mostly of hydrocarbons and is sometimes enhanced with benzene to increase octane ratings and is used as fuel in internal combustion engines. Unleaded gasoline is manufactured to meet the requirement of new model automobiles in the US since 1975, because in that year catalytic converters were made mandatory for all vehicles sold in the US. Lead was removed from gasoline because lead emissions poison the metals used in catalytic converters. Lead had been added to gasoline since the 1920's as tetraethyllead (TEL), historically referred to as "ethyl." Exposure to high levels of lead can cause vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, coma or even death, but lead emissions from automobiles consisted of lead oxide particles which settle out near highways. Lead removal from gasoline in the US has resulted in a clear, measurable decrease in lead in the urban environments in the US.

This element is useful producing energy needed to power cities and regions of countries. The fissionable isotope of uranium is uranium-235. Scientist discovered that this isotope could be induced to release energy when a thermal (slow) neutron strikes this isotope's nucleus producing smaller mass fragments, additional neutrons, and energy that stemmed from mass from those reactants converted to energy, the so-called mass defect. Nuclear plants were built to house this process beginning in the early 1950s. This process of splitting atoms is called fission.

	<entry term="Visible Light">
		<definition>The light of the electromagnetic spectrum that we perceive with our naked eye. The wavelengths of light that we can see are between roughly 380 nanometers to 700 nanometers. Blue (shortest visible wavelength) light is preferably scattered by gases and particles in our atmosphere (see Rayleigh scattering) and this creates the blue sky that we perceive when looking away from the sun during daylight. When the sun is at its peak at noon, we see white light, since the light travels through the least amount of atmosphere, undergoing the least atmospheric scattering and therefore includes most of the visible wavelengths and therefore this mixture of light appears white. As the sun moves across the sky and the solar incident angle increases, the sunlight has to travel through more and more of the atmosphere--before it strikes our eyes at the surface of the earth--which causes increased scattering, again of blue light more than longer wavelengths. Mid-day, the sun will appear to be yellow and at sunset sunlight has to travel through the longest path of atmosphere scattering almost all blue, most green, and lots of yellow light, leaving mostly red sunlight to be seen by us. This means sunsets and sunrises often look reddish.

		<definition>Water consists of two hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom (H2O). Water covers three-fourths of the Earth's surface, 60-70% of the world's weight, regenerates and redistributes through evaporation and other atmospheric processes. Water is involved in electrical charge separation because it has two types and positions of atoms giving it a net dipole movement. Water vapor also absorbs 17% of solar radiation in the troposphere, thus making it one of the two principal greenhouse gases. Of the solar energy absorbed by the Earth's surface a little more than half goes into latent heat, which is heat absorbed by water because of its transformation from a liquid to a gas. When these molecules condense back into a liquid, usually higher in the atmosphere, they released that energy back into the atmosphere as local warming.[Chemical Reviews; v77; 219-262; 1977.]</definition>

This assumption is based on astrophysical observations of many other stars. The best scientific conclusions are that when our sun was young it had a luminosity (total energy output) of 70-80% of what it is today; however, there has clearly been (based on geological records and long term evidence for the presence of liquid water) approximately the SAME long term planetary temperature on earth (about 15 degrees C, averaged planet-wide) instead of colder earlier surface temperatures followed later by warmer surface temperatures. This paradox suggests that the planet's surface temperature may have been controlled by atmospheric gases whose concentrations varied over time while keeping (via the greenhouse effect) the surface temperature relatively constant (see Gaia hypothesis). [Science; v33n6; 20; 1993.] [The Atmospheric Journal; v98n6; 2268; 1989.] [Science, v177, 52-56; 1972.]</definition>

These substances are then dissolve in the water droplets and are deposited on the surface in which the water droplets come into contact with.

	<entry term="Wien's Displacement Law ">
		<definition>The relationship between wavelength and temperature in relation to blackbody radiation. The wavelength decreases as the temperature increases. The common formula to determine this relationship is Plank's Formula. [Eisberg, R &amp; Resnick, R. "Thermal Radiation." in Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, &amp; Particles. 2nd ed. New York: Wiley, 1985.]</definition>

	<entry term="Wind Energy ">
		<definition>Using the wind to turn a windmill blade to generate electricity. The blades collect the wind's energy as it goes over the blades because they slow down the speed of the wind; the blades are spun and the wind is slowed. The blades are connected to a drive shaft which is turning an electric generator to produce electricity. [Energy Economics; v1; 1; 2007.]  [Renewable Energy; v32; 2242-2246; 2007.]</definition>

	<entry term="Wind Rose">
		<definition>A diagram that presents information about wind speed and direction for a particular area over a certain amount of time. The diagram is a circle with spokes. The center is 0 and as the wind frequency increases bars extend from the center of the circle to the outside of the circle, in the direction the wind is blowing. Direction can be determined by which way the bar is extending to the outside of the circle because the wind rose is set up like a compass. Information for a windrose is gathered by monitoring stations throughout the area being monitored. By determining wind speed, direction, and frequency with a wind rose, movement of air, and pollutants can be predicted. [Atmospheric Environment; v40; 7480-7493; 2006.] [Cold Regions Science and Technology; v47;171-179; 2007.]</definition>

	<entry term="Wind ">
		<definition>The natural movement of air from one location to another in the planet's atmosphere due to differences in air pressure. For major urban centers, gaseous pollution produced there from, for instance, internal combustion engines can be moved from where those toxic substances are released downwind to the open ocean or otherwise away from the populated area. This transportation process takes times and the anthropogenic components react with each other and sunlight over time. This results in changing pollutant concentrations over time. Since wind is a physical movement of air, this also affects the mixing and dilution of atmospheric particles. Wind affects the process by which particles in the nucleation mode collide and coagulate to form accumulation mode then coarse mode particles, and in general, higher surface winds dilute and decrease particle formation from vapor phase condensation.

	<entry term="Xylene ">
		<definition>An aromatic hydrocarbon used as a common industrial solvent, also named dimethylbenzene; exists as 3 isomers: m-xylene, o-xylene, and p-xylene. Xylene is usually obtained from petroleum and natural gas distillates. It is used in paint, rubber and leather industries, and also as a cleaning agent or degreaser.

	<entry term="Younger Dryas Period">
		<definition>A transition from the last glacial period, to the present interglacial period punctured by a brief and intense return to cold conditions around 10,900 years ago. Scientists believe this occurred because of the changes in atmospheric circulation resulting from large releases of melt water from glaciers.
