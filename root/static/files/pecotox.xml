	<ns1:entry term="absolute fitness">
		<ns1:definition>Capability of an individual to reproduce successfully, i.e., to transfer genes to the next generation. Note 1:  	If differences in individual genotypes affect fitness, then the frequencies of genotypes increasing fitness will increase over generations due to natural selection.Note 2:  	Darwinian fitness is the lifetime reproductive success of an organism or genotype, indexed by the average number of offspring that it produces, relative to other organisms or genotypes, and hence the relative number of copies of its genes that it passes on to future generations.Note 3.  	Absolute fitness (Wabs) (of a genotype) is the ratio between the number of individuals with that genotype after selection to those before selection, calculated for a single generation from absolute numbers or from frequencies.Wabs = Nafter/NbeforeIf Wabs &gt; 1.0, the genotype frequency increases. If Wabs &lt; 1.0, its frequency decreases.Note 4:  	Relative fitness is the fitness of individuals with a genotype (a) relative to fitness of individuals with competing genotypes (b, etc). Wrel(a) = Wabs(a)/Wabs(b)Relative fitness can therefore take any non-negative value including 0.Note 5:  	Inclusive fitness is the degree of adaptation of an organism to its environment, estimated from the number of genes belonging to its genotype that are passed on to the next generation, relative to those of other genotypes, counting both genes that it passes on directly and those that it shares with close relatives and passed on by them.[18]</ns1:definition>

Bioaccessibility, like bioavailability, is a function of both chemical speciation and biological properties. Even substances bound to the surface of particles may not be accessible to organisms that require the substances to be in solution. In general, bioaccessibility becomes bioavailability only after chemical activity that may itself be the result of biological activity.[1]Note 2: 	In ecotoxicology, bioaccessibility is often measured by assessment of the fraction of a substance released from a matrix (usually soil or sediment) into an aqueous medium under defined laboratory conditions. Such measurements must be interpreted with care as laboratory conditions rarely equate to those in nature.Note 3: 	In human toxicology, bioaccessibility may be measured as the amount of a specific compound released from a matrix when exposed in vitro to conditions mimicking those in the human gut and small intestine. This gives no measure of bioaccessibility on the skin, in the lung, or in the eye.)</ns1:definition>

	<ns1:entry term="equilibrium">
		<ns1:definition>State of a system in which the macroscopic properties of the system become uniform and independent of time. If the temperature is uniform throughout the system, a state of thermal equilibrium has been reached; if the pressure is uniform, a state of hydrostatic equilibrium has been reached; and if the chemical potential of each component is uniform, a state of chemical equilibrium has been reached. If all these quantities become uniform, the system is said to be in a state of complete thermodynamic equilibrium.Note 1:  	Complete thermodynamic equilibrium can be expressed in many ways, depending on which variables are of interest. For solubility purposes, the important variables are T, p and the chemical potentials ?i of the C components. Equilibrium conditions involving these variables may be obtained by the condition that the variation of the Gibbs energy, expressed in terms of T, p and the amount of substance ni of the C components, is zero, ?G(T, p, ni) = 0, i.e., the Gibbs energy is a minimum. If the variation is negative, an irreversible change of the system can occur.Note 2:  	Solubility equilibrium is an example of a state of complete thermodynamic equilibrium. For example, a saturated solution of a solid in a liquid at a fixed temperature and pressure is in a state of complete thermodynamic equilibrium. If the system is subjected to a small increase in temperature, a small portion of solid will dissolve to restore the equilibrium (if the solubility increases with temperature), while if there is a small decrease in temperature, a small portion of solid will precipitate. This is the basis for determining accurate values of solubility by approaching the equilibrium solubility from both supersaturation and undersaturation directions.Modified and extended from [1]</ns1:definition>

		<ns1:definition>Substance that is absolutely required for the normal growth and development of a defined organism throughout a complete life cycle.Note 1:  	According to criteria of essentiality suggested by Arnon and Stout, a nutrient can be called essential if: (i) its deficiency makes it impossible for an organism to complete its life cycle; (ii) its deficiency is specific to the element in question and can be corrected only by supplying this element; and (iii) the nutrient is directly involved in the organism’s nutrition.Note 2:  	It has been suggested that an element should be considered essential if its addition enhances growth or if it can substitute for one of the elements that satisfy the criteria of Arnon and Stout. It has also been suggested that three other elements, which do not satisfy the criteria for many plant species but contribute indirectly to their survival, should be classified as essential. These elements are nickel (urea transformations), cobalt (N2 fixation), and silicon.Note 3:  	Related terms are “essential element” and “essential metal”, which may be given the same definition, simply by substituting “element” or “metal” for nutrient.Note 4:  	The term is often used misleadingly since it is meaningless unless accompanied by a statement of which organisms show a requirement for the nutrient.[16]</ns1:definition>

Absolute fitness (Wabs) (of a genotype) is the ratio between the number of individuals with that genotype after selection to those before selection, calculated for a single generation from absolute numbers or from frequencies.Wabs = Nafter/NbeforeIf Wabs &gt; 1.0, the genotype frequency increases. If Wabs &lt; 1.0, its frequency decreases.Note 4:  	Relative fitness is the fitness of individuals with a genotype (a) relative to fitness of individuals with competing genotypes (b, etc). Wrel(a) = Wabs(a)/Wabs(b)Relative fitness can therefore take any non-negative value including 0.Note 5:  	Inclusive fitness is the degree of adaptation of an organism to its environment, estimated from the number of genes belonging to its genotype that are passed on to the next generation, relative to those of other genotypes, counting both genes that it passes on directly and those that it shares with close relatives and passed on by them.[18]</ns1:definition>

For a reaction involving more than one reactant, with the concentrations of the reactants in their stoichiometric ratios, the half life of each reactant is the same, and may be called the half life of the reaction. If the concentrations of reactants are not in their stoichiometric ratios, there are different half lives for different reactants, and one cannot speak of the half life of the reaction.See GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN ECOTOXICOLOGY (IUPAC Recommendations 2009): also biological half life, elimination half life.[1]</ns1:definition>
